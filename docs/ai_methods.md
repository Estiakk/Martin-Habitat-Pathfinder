# AI Methods for Mars Resource Management

## Reinforcement Learning Approaches

### Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Suitable for discrete action spaces (e.g., on/off decisions for systems)
- Value-based method for learning optimal policies
- Potential applications:
  - Binary control of habitat subsystems
  - Scheduling of maintenance activities
  - Resource allocation between competing systems

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Policy gradient method with stability improvements
- Works well with continuous action spaces
- Potential applications:
  - Fine-grained control of power distribution
  - Optimization of water recycling parameters
  - Adaptive thermal management

### Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
- Decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks
- Enables handling of different time scales and abstraction levels
- Potential applications:
  - Multi-level resource management (strategic/tactical/operational)
  - Coordinating long-term planning with immediate responses
  - Managing interdependent resource systems

### Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
- Coordinates multiple autonomous agents toward common goals
- Handles distributed decision-making and resource competition
- Potential applications:
  - Coordinating multiple robotic systems
  - Managing resource allocation across habitat modules
  - Balancing competing resource needs between subsystems

## Predictive Analytics Methods
