# Project Objectives & Scope

## Primary Goals
- Develop AI-driven resource allocation systems for Martian habitats
- Focus on optimizing management of:
  - Power
  - Water
  - Oxygen
  - Materials
  - Construction resources

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Percentage reduction in Earth-resupply mass
- Improvement in resource-use efficiency
- System resilience to environmental disruptions
- Adaptation capability to changing mission parameters

## Mission Scenarios
- Initial outpost (short-duration, limited crew)
- Expanded research base (medium-duration, moderate crew)
- Long-duration colony (permanent presence, larger crew)

## Resource Prioritization
- Initial outpost: Power and oxygen prioritized
- Expanded base: Water recycling and ISRU capabilities enhanced
- Long-duration colony: Construction materials and full resource loop closure

## Project Scope Boundaries
- Focus on resource management AI, not habitat structural design
- Emphasis on Mars-specific environmental constraints
- Integration with existing NASA mission architectures
- Consideration of both robotic and human mission requirements
