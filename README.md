# Martian Habitat Pathfinder

A comprehensive project for analyzing and simulating optimal habitat locations on Mars using reinforcement learning and data-driven approaches.

## Project Overview

The Martian Habitat Pathfinder project aims to identify and evaluate potential habitat locations on Mars by analyzing topographical data, environmental conditions, and resource availability. The project leverages reinforcement learning algorithms integrated with large language models to optimize habitat placement decisions.

## Features

- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Processes Mars topographical data (MOLA) and other environmental datasets
- **Advanced Analytics**: Terrain analysis and feature engineering for habitat suitability assessment
- **Simulation Environment**: Virtual testing environment for habitat placement scenarios
- **RL-based Decision Making**: Reinforcement learning models for optimizing habitat locations
- **Interactive UI**: User interface for visualizing and interacting with the analysis results
- **LLM Integration**: Large Language Model integration for enhanced decision support
